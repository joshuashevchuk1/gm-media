// Because we cannot guarantee the platform this client will always run on,
// there's no guarantee an implementation won't compile using the
// `DummyAudioDeviceModule`. That WebRTC implementation does nothing and no
// audio will be provided.
//
// To overcome these challenges, this is a provided implementation that does
// the bare minimum to provide audio. Nothing more, nothing less. If an end
// user requires more functionality and complexity, they are relegated to
// rolling their own implementation.

  // Not only does this remove the need for synchronization in this class (as

  // a deadlock when closing the peer connection:
  //
  // When audio data is passed to `ConferenceAudioTrack::OnData()`, it is
  // called on whatever thread `audio_callback_` is called on. When attempting
  // to read the audio csrcs and ssrcs from
  // `RtpReceiverInterface::GetSources()`, a blocking call will be made to the
  // worker thread (via the rtp receiver proxy layer) if the current thread is
  // NOT the worker thread.
  //
  // `ConferenceAudioTrack::OnData()` is called while holding a mutex in
  // WebRTC's `AudioMixerImpl::Mix()` method (also running on whatever thread
  // `audio_callback_` is called on).
  //
  // At the same time, when closing the peer connection,
  // `AudioMixerImpl::RemoveSource()` is called on the worker thread and
  // attempts to acquire the mutex held by `AudioMixerImpl::Mix()`, blocking
  // the worker thread.
  //
  // Therefore, it is possible for the worker thread to be blocked while
  // waiting for the `AudioMixerImpl` mutex, while
  // `ConferenceAudioTrack::OnData()` is blocked waiting for the worker thread
  // to read the audio csrcs and ssrcs.
  //
  // By ensuring that this class is always called on the worker thread, this
  // deadlock is avoided, as:
  //   1. The worker thread is a task queue, and task queue operatons are
  //   executed sequentially.
  //   2. `ConferenceAudioTrack::OnData()` is called on the worker thread and
  //   therefore does not need to switch to the worker thread to read the
  //   audio csrcs and ssrcs.
